# To Do's:

2018 06 23 --> 2018 06 24
-------------------------

- [X] Merging convective scheme and diffusion scheme into residual function
    + tested --> working
	+ problem for longer simulations
- [ ] update solver function
- [X] update jacobian
	--> implemented just constant jacobian
	--> updated chapter in docu (roughly finished)
	--> image of jacobian structure
- [X] optimize residual funcion using numba
    + tested --> working
- [ ] test jacobian as class with an update method
- [X] start using boundary conditions in residual
    + into residual, solver, main, updated setup file
- [ ] test notebook about method for small frequencies in impedance measurements (fitting elipse and so on)
- [ ] add chapter to documentation about python implementation
