	abstract = {Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov (JFNK) methods are synergistic combinations of Newton-type methods for superlinearly convergent solution of nonlinear equations and Krylov subspace methods for solving the Newton correction equations. The link between the two methods is the Jacobian-vector product, which may be probed approximately without forming and storing the elements of the true Jacobian, through a variety of means. Various approximations to the Jacobian matrix may still be required for preconditioning the resulting Krylov iteration. As with Krylov methods for linear problems, successful application of the JFNK method to any given problem is dependent on adequate preconditioning. JFNK has potential for application throughout problems governed by nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations and integro-diﬀerential equations. In this survey paper, we place JFNK in context with other nonlinear solution algorithms for both boundary value problems (BVPs) and initial value problems (IVPs). We provide an overview of the mechanics of JFNK and attempt to illustrate the wide variety of preconditioning options available. It is emphasized that JFNK can be wrapped (as an accelerator) around another nonlinear ﬁxed point method (interpreted as a preconditioning process, potentially with signiﬁcant code reuse). The aim of this paper is not to trace fully the evolution of JFNK, nor to provide proofs of accuracy or optimal convergence for all of the constituent methods, but rather to present the reader with a perspective on how JFNK may be applicable to applications of interest and to provide sources of further practical information.},

	abstract = {An implicit Newton–Krylov ﬁnite volume algorithm has been developed for efﬁcient steady-state computation of the power-law non-Newtonian ﬂuid ﬂows. The pseudo-compressibility technique is used for the coupling of continuity and momentum equations. The spatial discretization is central (second-order) for both convective and diffusive terms and the accuracy of the solution is veriﬁed. The nine block diagonal Jacobian matrix (needed for implicit formulation) is computed directly through the ﬂux differentiation. Five-diagonal and three-diagonal block matrices (the simpliﬁed versions of the main Jacobian matrix) are used with the ILU(0 \& 1) and the Thomas linear solvers for preconditioning, respectively. The performance of the Newton-GMRES solver is examined in detail for different preconditioning strategies. The effects of the power-law behavior index and Re number on the convergence rate are also studied. The performance of the Newton-BiCGSTAB and the Newton-GMRES solvers are compared with each other. The results show, the ILU(1)/Newton-GMRES is the most efﬁcient combination that is robust even in high Reynolds number shear-thinning ﬂuid ﬂow cases.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose an efﬁcient parallel implementation of the GMRES method for GPU clusters. This implementation requires us to parallelize the GMRES algorithm between CPUs of the cluster. Hence, all parallel and intensive computations on local data are performed on GPUs and reduction operations to compute global results are carried out by CPUs. The performances of our parallel GMRES solver are evaluated on test matrices of sizes exceeding 107 rows. They show that solving large and sparse linear systems on a GPU cluster is faster than that performed on its CPU counterpart. It is noticed that a cluster of 12 GPUs is about 8 times faster than a cluster of 12 CPUs and about 5 times faster than a cluster of 24 CPUs.},

	abstract = {In order to fully characterize an electrochemical system such as a fuel cell, the electrical impedance must be determined. The objective of this project is to obtain this measurement via a process called electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), in real time. The resulting product will be useful in engineering better electrochemical systems because of the time saved by means of an instantaneous EIS method. This rapid EIS feature is the needed by our sponsor, NuVant Energy Systems Inc, to improve their already successful potentiostat, the EZstat. The EZstat is a device used to measure input and output voltages and currents, and is capable, but not rated, of performing manual EIS. Manual EIS is the current method used as is a slow, tedious process. Adding the ability of EIS in real time would allow them to corner the market on potentiostats. To do this, the team decided to divide the project into two major phases, manual EIS and real-time EIS. Using the EZstat to perform manual EIS creates a set of data to be used as a basis for the creation of real-time EIS. All manual EIS data has been gathered, and a system has been devised to send out all input frequencies in a near instantaneous manner.},
